# Introduction

Grief can feel like the loneliest experience. We carry our losses as if they're singular, incomprehensible to anyone else. Yet when we create space to witness mourning together—not to fix it, not to rush past it, but simply to be present with it—something shifts.

Requiary transforms anonymous grief messages into a luminous constellation. Each submission becomes a glowing point of light in a shared cosmos. The system identifies resonances between expressions, revealing unexpected connections between individual griefs. Your loss finds company in strangers' words. Patterns emerge that honor both the specificity of each mourning and the ways grief connects us.

A generative soundscape emerges from the aggregate presence of messages—not a preset ambient bed, but sound generated from the data itself. Semantic similarity becomes harmonic consonance. The installation breathes, creating acoustic architecture for contemplation.

Enter, witness, contribute—and discover what mourning reveals when it's no longer hidden.
